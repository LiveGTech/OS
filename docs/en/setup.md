# Set up a device running LiveG OS
When you first get a device running LiveG OS, you will need to set it up. This can be achieved by following the steps shown when you first turn on the device.

LiveG OS will guide you through choosing system settings, setting up a user account and more through this setup procedure. Once you have set up your device, you can then start using it right away.

## Setup procedure
The following steps below are what are shown through LiveG OS's setup procedure, in order.

### 1. Select your language
LiveG OS will show a list of languages that will be used throughout the system. From this list, select **English**.

### 2. Choose language settings
Once you have chosen your language, you will be further asked what language region/variation you wish to read text in, in addition to the keyboard layout you wish to use to input text.

For example, if you speak British English, you would select **English (United Kingdom)** for **language region/variation** and **British QWERTY** for **keyboard layout**.

Once you are happy with the chosen settings, press **next**.

### 3. Enter your personal details
You will be asked to enter your name, which will be used by the system to identify you. We recommend that you enter your full name, but you can enter any name, such as your nickname or username.

Your name will be displayed when signing into your device. Entering your full name may help with identifying your device, or for returning your device in the event that it gets lost.

Once you have entered your name, press **next**.

### 4. Choose online interaction options
After entering your personal details, you will be asked how you wish your device to interact with LiveG.

These options can affect your privacy, so it is recommended that you read the [privacy information on LiveG OS](privacy.md) before making your choices. Both options are entirely voluntary and can be changed at any time later on in the **Settings** app.

Enabling these options can help to enhance LiveG OS and make LiveG OS better in the long run, but if you are concerned about the privacy implications of enabling these options, then you may turn them off.

Once you have made your choices, press **next**.

### 5. Complete the setup process
This is the last step, telling you that setup is complete. At this stage, you may go back and review the setup choices you've made to see if they are correct, and change them if needed. Once you're happy, press **finish** and you'll be able to use your device.

The choices you have made during setup can always be changed later on in the Settings app.
