# Privacy information
Having privacy is one of the fundamental human rights, and this equally applies to digital privacy. LiveG takes a thorough approach to ensuring our users can get the privacy they need, which means that our users have a choice in how they wish to interact with our online services.

When you set up a device to run LiveG OS, you will be asked which online services you wish to opt into or out of. Opting into any of our online services is entirely voluntary and up to you; though some services can enhance LiveG OS when enabled. If — later on — you change your mind about the privacy choices you have made, you can change your choices at any time by opening the **Settings** app, then going to **interaction and privacy**.

Any data that is sent from your device in the background will not contain anything that would reveal your personal information. **Your data will never be used for the purposes of targeted advertisement tracking and will never be sold** as this directly violates LiveG's values.

## What online services are you running that may interact with LiveG OS?
We currently operate two online services that interact with LiveG OS:

* Our **system update** service that can be used to update your device to the latest version of LiveG OS and — when enabled — can automatically notify you when a new version or security update of LiveG OS is released
* Our **device usage research telemetry** service that — when enabled — can collect information about how you use your device (a list of the information collected is shown later on in this page) and send that data to LiveG so that improvements to LiveG OS can be made based on your own usage

## What data do you collect?
When you opt out of all our online services, we do not collect any data.

We do not collect data through our system update service.

The data that we collect for our device usage research telemetry service is subject to change between system updates as our research objectives change. The data we collect typically comprises of what apps you have installed and what system settings you have enabled.

We currently do not collect any data through our device usage research telemetry service, though we plan to collect some data in the future.

You can choose whether you wish to be notified when our research objectives change (or otherwise what data we collect changes) by enabling the **be notified when research objectives change** option under **interaction and privacy** in the **Settings** app.

For all our services, we **never** collect any of the following data in the background:

* Your name or other personal information
* Your passwords
* The personal files that you have created, downloaded, or have otherwise stored
* Your precise location (however, we may collect an estimate of the country or wide region you are in based on your language or time zone settings)

## What do you do with the data that you collect?
For our device usage research telemetry service, we analyse the data to make informed decisions as to what improvements to LiveG OS should be made or prioritised. In the interest of openness, the data we collect may be shared publicly, albeit in a cumulative, aggregated format that cannot be used to determine the exact configuration of a given device.

Consumers of the data that we publish might freely use the data for — but not limited to — any of the following purposes:

* Determining the most popular devices that run LiveG OS, and how many devices run LiveG OS
* Evaluating LiveG's dominance or minoritisation in market share
* Evaluating the dominance or minoritisation of any third-party apps in market share
* Determining whether there is a digital divide between certain countries, and seeing which countries have greater or lesser access to technology

## Can the data my device has sent be withdrawn or deleted?
As we have no way to trace the data that we have stored back to your own device (the data is stored on our servers completely anonymously), we are unable to delete or otherwise withdraw the data that your device has sent.

If you are a developer or rights owner of an app that has been recorded as being installed or uninstalled in our open data, then you may request the deletion of the records relating to your app by contacting LiveG by email at [hi@liveg.tech](mailto:hi@liveg.tech). You will need to provide sufficient evidence that you are a developer or rights holder of the app in question. While we can delete the records in our own publications, we are not responsible for, and therefore are unable to delete the records in copies or reproductions of our data made by third parties.

## How can I trust that this privacy information is accurate?
LiveG OS is open-source software, meaning that everyone has permission to freely view and modify LiveG OS's code. The code relating to LiveG OS can be found at [github.com/LiveGTech/OS](https://github.com/LiveGTech/OS).

By auditing the code, you can determine whether you can put your trust in the information we have provided here. If you do not have experience with software development or computer programming, then we recommend speaking to someone you trust who has the experience necessary to audit the code for you.

## Who should I contact if I have any queries or concerns about my privacy?
You can contact LiveG by email at [hi@liveg.tech](mailto:hi@liveg.tech) with your queries or concerns about your privacy in relation to LiveG OS. We will do our best to respond helpfully and in good time, though it should be noted that we are not under a legal obligation to respond to all requests.
